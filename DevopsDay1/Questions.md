# Day 1 – Linux Fundamentals (Practice Tasks)

## Task 1: Environment Awareness
- Identify your current working directory
- Find your logged-in username
- Identify your UID and GID
- Determine which shell you are currently using

---

## Task 2: File System Exploration
- List all files in the current directory, including hidden ones
- Identify file permissions, ownership, and size
- Locate where system binaries are stored
- Identify where log files are usually stored

---

## Task 3: Disk & Memory Inspection
- Check total disk size and available disk space
- Identify which directory is consuming the most space
- Check system memory usage
- Identify how much free memory is available

---

## Task 4: Process Management
- View running processes
- Identify:
  - one system process
  - one user process
- Find the PID of a running process
- Understand which process consumes the most CPU or memory

---

## Task 5: Files & Permissions (Very Important)
- Create a new directory for today’s practice
- Inside it:
  - create two files
  - make one file executable
  - make the other file readable and writable only
- Verify and **clearly understand** the permission difference

---

## Task 6: Real-World Thinking
- Imagine a production server where:
  - disk is 100% full
  - memory is exhausted
- Write down:
  - what symptoms users will see
  - which services might fail first
  - what a DevOps engineer should check immediately

---

## Submission Checklist
When done, paste:
- Outputs/screenshots of your checks
- Permission listing proof
- Your reasoning for Task 6
